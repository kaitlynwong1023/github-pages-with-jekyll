Brag Sheet:

Hobbies:

I played the piano for majority of my life and it is a skill I treasure. I'm grateful that my mom signed me up at a young age of 
4. Though I do not compete or perform anymore, I still play frequently for pleasure.

I enjoy traveling and tasting cuisine from across the globe. I have had the privilege to visit scenic places like London
and Paris and ethnic places like Korea and Taiwan.

Achievements in high school:

I was heavily involved in volunteering throughout my four years. I was secretary of Interact Club and a lot of my Saturdays were
spent volunteering at my chinese school (which I attended myself for 10 years and graduated from)

I would consider myself proficient in academics. I worked hard to maintain my grades and achieve high test scores.
One of my proudest accomplishments is getting accepted into my choices of colleges in my senior year.
